The last decade has seen a rapid, planet-scale growth in deployment and usage of smart mobile devices, ambient sensors, smartphone applications and advanced communication technologies. This era has prompted for planet-scale data collection, storage, processing and dissemination technologies, advancing our knowledge about human behavior and interactions. Evolution of such technologies and methodologies, in addition to the high investments in Internet of things (IoT) in Asia, has inherently led to a number of security, privacy and ethical issues as well as new systems, networking, and application challenges.  What are the emerging research challenges when we think about sensing at the town, country, or planet scale? 

This 6th HotPlanet workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners in networking, wireless, mobile computing and systems to understand the challenges ahead and advance the dialogue on topics related to large-scale measurements and big data analytics centered around individuals. It aims to attract publications on: large-scale data collection, data analysis and knowledge-discovery; large-scale deployment experiences, measurement technologies, and applications; large-scale mobile sensing systems and social media data analytics.

Topics of interest include, but not limited to:

<ul>
<li>Scaling challenges for sensing</li>
<li>Large-scale data analytics (social media, mobility traces, mobility prediction, etc.)</li>
<li>Large-scale Mobile Sensing systems</li>
<li>Big Data privacy & security </li>
<li>Large-scale measurement methodologies</li>
<li>Large-scale social sensing applications</li>
<li>Large-scale virtualized sensing infrastructure</li> 
<li>Cloud support for large-scale mobile applications</li>
<li>Incentive models for encouraging users and businesses to collect and contribute data</li>
<li>Profiling, personalization, geotargeting </li>
<li>Programming paradigms for large scale data collection</li>
<li>Data quality issues </li>
<li>Internet of Things</li>
<li>Smart energy-aware systems </li>
<li>Large scale mobile application marketing experience</li>
<li>Regulatory, legal and ethical issues in planet-wide data collection</li>
</ul>
