# Lecture 27 - Multimedia + QoS

## Overview

In theory, this is the last lecture with content for the final exam!  We will wrap up the content on multimedia and pivot into discussing Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Experience (QoE), traffic shaping, and net neutrality.  For the last lecture, there will be a brief presentation on short video services and then the majority of the content will focus on a final exam review.
