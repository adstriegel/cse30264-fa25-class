# Lecture 16 - DNS

## Overview

In today's lecture, we will wrap up a few left over items from the control plane (BGP policies), ICMP, SDN controllers, and then we will pivot to focus on DNS.  We will work through DNS with the content possibly spanning today's lecture as well as Wednesday's lecture.  The mid-term exams will be returned in the last 10 minutes of class with a brief discussion of commonly missed items.
