# Lecture 26 - Multimedia

## Overview

We will finish out the security content today looking at 802.1x and wrapping up various network security devices.  Once we wrap up that content, we will then pivot into multimedia, examining how JPEG, MPEG, and how audio / video are encoded. As time allows, we will start to talk about Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Experience (QoE), and net neutrality.
