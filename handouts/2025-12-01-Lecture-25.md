# Lecture 25 - Security + Multimedia

## Overview

Welcome back from Thanksgiving break!  In the last lecture, we looked at the foundations of digital certificates, the PKI, and explored various aspects of signing, hashing, and other security primitives.  We explored TLS / SSL and started on VPNs.  In today's lecture, we will focus on the underlying network security elements and protocols, examining IPsec, 802.1x, and the numerous network security devices and terminology. As time allows, we will pivot into multimedia examining how audio and video are encoded.
