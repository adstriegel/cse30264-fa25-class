# Lecture 20 - Link Layer (Last) + Mobile

## Overview

In the last lecture, we got through a fair amount of the content with respect to the link layer.  We have a few more items to wrap up, discussing VLANs, MPLS, fault tolerance, and a few more aspects.  We will talk briefly as well a bit about various link layers wired technologies as we will then be pivoting into wireless which will cover this week and early next week.

## Readings - Lecture 20

* Chapter 7 - Mobile and Wireless

## Notes

* As the lecture will include discussions of Coding Project 2 - Part 1, the lecture will be recorded and shared via Canvas.

## Handouts
