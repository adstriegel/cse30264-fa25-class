# Lecture 18 - Link Layer - Part 2

## Overview

At the end of the last lecture, we finished up the DNS content and started briefly in on Layer 2, aka the Link Layer.  We briefly talked about the differences between routers and switches.  In today's lecture, we will dive much more deeply into Layer 2, getting into the various link types, random / shared access, and into LANs, ARP, and VLANs.
