# Lecture 23 - Mobile + Security

## Overview

We have just a small bit of material to close out cellular networks as well as with respect to roaming / tunneling.  With that material complete, we will pivot over into security, looking at fundamentals of security and discussing various mechanisms with regards to encryption.  We will continue the security material through at least next Monday.  We will also do a deep dive on Part 2 for Coding Project 2 - Part 2.
