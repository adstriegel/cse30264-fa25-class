# Lecture 22 - Mobile / Wireless (Part 2)

## Overview

We will continue on with the wireless content pruning a few items that were previously in the slides as we went fairly deep on the PHY layer for wireless.  We will walk through WiFi operation and then go through cellular fundamentals.  As time allows, we will then begin to pivot into network security.
