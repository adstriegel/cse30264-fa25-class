# Lecture 17 - DNS + Link Layer

## Overview

In today's lecture, we will wrap up DNS and then transition into discussing the link layer (Layer 2).  Whereas we have focused chiefly on enabling applications, transport, and end-to-end networking, we will now look at how we transit across each individual link in the network and the various technologies that enable such connectivity.  We will also be doing a deep dive into Wireshark to set the stage for Homework 3 and diving into the information from the various Layer 2, Layer 3, and Layer 4 headers.
